## What is SCADA?

---

### Definitions

**SCADA** is abbreviation from phrase „_Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition_”. **SCADA** system is mostly used in connection with software and hardware components, for example programmable logic controllers (**PLC**) and remote terminal units (**RTU**).

**HMI** (_Human Machine Interface_) is part of a bigger **SCADA** system, with its **PLC**, **RTU** and other functions. **HMI** is system which operators use to interact with **SCADA**, while overriding **SCADA** system implements all the processes connected with collecting, storing data and controlling hardware. **HMI** interfaces are often equipped with screens and, in perfect case, easy to use control panels and contol elements. They can use graphics and visualizations, simplifying control and interpretation of data and functions. 

### Tasks

Tasks of **SCADA** systems:

 • Constant communication with **PLC** controller

 • Readable data visualization in real time 

 • Database control with appropriate technological informations 

 • Alarm installation control 

 • Generating technological process’ progress raports 

### Applications

**SCADA** systems systems are especially important with _complicated, mulit-scale_ industrial installations. Ability to manage work of many components simultaneously is important, in opposite of simple **HMI** systems. **SCADA** systems nable organizations to monitor and report processes based on real time data and archive data to process and evaluate in the future.
