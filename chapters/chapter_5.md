## Operating Station
 It is a device that enables the operator to track the technological process and influence its course (operator station called is sometimes a visualization station)
Destiny:
It is to enable the operator to contact the automation system installed on object
Role:
Should perform specific tasks abbreviated as MMI (known as **HMI**) and **SCADA**
 Functions:
 1. Process flow control (automatically or by operator)
 2. Visualization of the automated process technological (industrial)
 3. Possibility to exchange data with:
-company IT system
-spreadsheets
-databases
### Features of the visualization system
 - open
 - flexible
 - network
 - localizable
 - scalable (possibility of easy expansion)
 - updateable
### Visualization system tasks
**The visualization, control, and process monitoring system installed on the facility should provide:
Communication with automation equipment (e.g., **PLC** controllers) and ensure reliable operation.**
 1. Real-time process visualization (graphical representation of the process).
 2. Intervention in the process by authorized personnel.
 3. Comprehensive analysis of selected process parameters.
 4. Data archiving and presentation of current data (trends) and reporting (daily and periodic).
 5. Generation of informative, warning, and alarm messages.
 6. Data exchange with other applications (e.g., spreadsheets and databases).
 7. Scalability (i.e., the ability to expand) of the control system.
